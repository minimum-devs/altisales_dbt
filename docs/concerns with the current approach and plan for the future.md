My apologies! It seems I hallucinated the `create_file` tool. I cannot directly create files.

However, I have the full content of the markdown file ready. I will provide it to you in a format that you can easily copy and paste into a new file named `concerns with the current approach and plan for the future.md` in the root of your dbt project.

# Concerns with the Current Dynamic DDL Approach and Plan for the Future

This document outlines potential performance concerns with the current approach of dynamically generating Data Definition Language (DDL) statements (schemas and views) within `on-run-end` hooks for the dbt project. It also proposes a plan for evolving the system to handle larger data volumes, more providers, and a greater number of tenants efficiently.

## Current Approach Overview

The current system utilizes two primary macros executed via `on-run-end` hooks:

1.  `macros/refresh_staging_views.sql`: Discovers raw schemas (e.g., `tenant_provider_raw_provider`), then dynamically discovers all tables within each raw schema. For each table, it fetches its columns and creates a corresponding staging view (e.g., `tenant_provider_stg_provider.table_name`) with appropriate column mappings and basic transformations.
2.  `macros/refresh_canonical_views.sql`: Discovers the staging schemas created above. For each staging schema, it dynamically discovers all views within it and creates corresponding canonical views (e.g., `tenant_provider_canonical.view_name`) that typically `SELECT *` from the staging views.

This approach is excellent for initial setup, rapid development, and ensuring that all raw data is represented in the staging and canonical layers without manual intervention for each new table or tenant.

## Concerns with the Current Approach at Scale

As the number of tenants, providers, and the volume of data (millions of records per table) grows significantly (e.g., 10 providers, 500 tenants, dozens of tables per provider), the current approach will face performance bottlenecks during `dbt run` operations. The primary reasons are:

1.  **Excessive Metadata Queries:**
    *   The macros heavily rely on querying `information_schema.tables` and `information_schema.columns` repeatedly within Jinja loops.
    *   **Discovery of raw schemas:** Runs once (minor).
    *   **Listing tables per raw schema:** Runs for each raw schema (e.g., 500 tenants * 1-10 providers, potentially ~500-5000 times if each provider for each tenant has a distinct raw schema).
    *   **Listing columns per table:** Runs for every table in every discovered raw schema. With 500 tenants and an average of 20 tables each, this could be ~10,000 queries to `information_schema.columns`.
    *   **Discovery of staging views:** Runs once (minor).
    *   **Listing views per staging schema:** Runs for each staging schema (~500 times).
    *   While fast for individual queries, thousands of such metadata queries during dbt's compilation/execution phase add significant overhead and are not what dbt is optimized for during a standard run.

2.  **Large Number of DDL Statements:**
    *   The project will generate and execute `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS`, `DROP VIEW IF EXISTS ... CASCADE`, and `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` for every table, for every tenant/provider, on every run.
    *   For 500 tenants and ~20 tables each, this means ~10,000 staging views and ~10,000 canonical views, resulting in ~20,000 `DROP` and ~20,000 `CREATE OR REPLACE` statements in total during the `on-run-end` phase.
    *   Executing tens of thousands of DDL statements, even simple ones, consumes considerable time and database resources.

3.  **View Performance on Large Datasets:**
    *   Currently, both staging and canonical layers are composed of views. Views are stored queries and do not store data themselves.
    *   When querying a canonical view (which might be a `UNION ALL` of multiple staging views from different providers for the same tenant), the query planner has to execute the logic of the canonical view, which in turn executes the logic of the underlying staging view(s), which then query the raw tables.
    *   With millions of records, these stacked views, especially with `UNION` operations, can lead to slow query performance for end-users or downstream dbt models. This doesn't directly impact the `dbt run` DDL generation time but affects the usability and performance of the data warehouse.

**Conclusion on Current Approach:** The `dbt run` time will not remain the same as data and tenant/provider counts grow; it will increase, potentially significantly, due to the cumulative time taken by metadata queries and DDL executions.

## Plan for the Future: Transition to Code Generation (Codegen)

To address these scaling concerns and align with dbt best practices for projects with dynamic or numerous sources, the recommended approach is to transition to a **code generation** strategy.

**Overview of Codegen Approach:**

1.  **Code Generation Macro(s):**
    *   Develop one or more dbt macros (e.g., `generate_source_models`, `generate_staging_models`) that perform the dynamic discovery of schemas, tables, and columns, similar to the current `refresh_*_views.sql` macros.
    *   However, instead of executing `CREATE VIEW` DDL statements directly, these codegen macros will *write the SQL content* for dbt models (`.sql` files) and potentially their configurations (`.yml` files) into the appropriate directories within your dbt project (e.g., `models/staging/outreach/`, `models/staging/salesloft/`, `models/canonical/`).
    *   These macros would be executed via `dbt run-operation your_codegen_macro`.

2.  **Frequency of Codegen:**
    *   The codegen process would not need to run on every `dbt run`. It would be executed:
        *   When new tenants are onboarded.
        *   When new providers are added.
        *   When Fivetran (or another process) adds new tables to raw schemas.
        *   Periodically (e.g., daily or weekly) if schema changes are frequent but not easily signaled.

3.  **Standard `dbt run`:**
    *   After the codegen macro(s) have created the `.sql` (and `.yml`) model files, your regular `dbt run` operates on a static set of dbt models.
    *   Dbt can then parse, compile, and execute these pre-generated models much more efficiently, leveraging its internal DAG and performance optimizations.

**Benefits of the Codegen Approach:**

*   **Improved `dbt run` Performance:** Regular runs will be significantly faster as they won't involve thousands of metadata queries or dynamic DDL generations.
*   **Alignment with dbt Paradigm:** This is the idiomatic dbt way to handle a large number of dynamically changing sources. It allows you to use standard dbt features like `ref()`, `source()`, model configurations, and testing more directly on the generated models.
*   **Better Version Control & Lineage:** The generated model files can be committed to version control (though this can be noisy if regeneration is frequent; careful strategy needed). Dbt's lineage will be clearer based on these static model definitions.
*   **Foundation for Materialization:** With static model files, it's straightforward to change materializations (from `view` to `table` or `incremental`) for staging or canonical models where performance dictates, further improving query times.

**Implementation Steps for Codegen:**

1.  **Adapt Current Macros:** The logic within `refresh_staging_views.sql` and `refresh_canonical_views.sql` for discovering schemas, tables, and columns, and for defining mappings, can be largely reused. The key change is to output strings (SQL model content) instead of executing DDL.
2.  **File Output:** Use Jinja or Python within the macro (if using `dbt-py`) to write these strings to the correct file paths within the `models/` directory.
3.  **Develop `.yml` Generation (Optional but Recommended):** Extend the codegen to also generate basic `.yml` files for the created models, defining sources, descriptions, and potentially tests or column properties.
4.  **Workflow Adjustment:** Define a process for when and how the codegen macros are run.

**Strategic Materialization (Post-Codegen):**

Once the codegen approach is in place:

*   **Staging Layer:** Can remain as views if transformations are light. If complex cleaning/casting is needed or raw data access is slow, consider materializing as `incremental` models or `tables`.
*   **Canonical/Intermediate Layer:** These are prime candidates for materialization (e.g., `table` or `incremental`), especially for entities that `UNION` data from multiple providers. This creates a persistent, performant single source of truth.
*   **Marts Layer:** (If/when developed) Almost always materialized as `tables`.

By adopting this plan, the dbt project can scale effectively to handle a large and dynamic multi-tenant environment while maintaining good performance and adhering to dbt best practices.
