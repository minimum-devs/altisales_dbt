# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/
# directory as views. These settings can be overridden in the individual model
# files using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.
models:
  altisales_dbt:
    # Config indicated by + and applies to all files under models/example/
    example:
      +materialized: view
      # schema will default to [tenant_code]_canonical by the macro

    # Config for staging models
    staging:
      +materialized: view
      outreach: # Corresponds to models/staging/outreach
        +schema: "stg_outreach" # Macro will prepend tenant_code, resulting in [tenant_code]_stg_outreach
      salesloft: # Corresponds to models/staging/salesloft
        +schema: "stg_salesloft" # Macro will prepend tenant_code, resulting in [tenant_code]_stg_salesloft
      # Add other source system staging configs here as needed

# The `vars` block is removed as dynamic_org_schema is no longer needed.
# The generate_schema_name macro will handle schema generation based on DBT_TENANT_CODE.
